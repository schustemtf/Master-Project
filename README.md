# Understanding-PFNs

In this project we analyzed [Prior data-fitted networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10510), proposed by MÃ¼ller et. al. 
We read all relevant literature on the (small) field and also alot on classic transfomers and in-context learning. From the gained knowledge we experimented with PFNs on a toy dataset of lines and sines using various techniques, insights and potential leads we obtained from our research.
